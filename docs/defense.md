# Broad Structure
## Topic-introductory part
- (optional) Introduction of myself
- the need and challenges of ML in medicine
- Introduction: origins of uncertainty in medicine
- The special case: diagnostic pipelines (away from isolated tasks)
- Uncertainty for clinical decisions (and the necessary ingredients: uncertainty estimation, propagationm, calibration, decision)

## My contributions to these problems
- The contribution of this thesis: Estimation + Propagation, Leveraging (decision), Calibration
- Takeaway of this thesis: ML (and UQ) is not just an application in medicine, it requires 

## Main Methods: Papers 
- Paper 1: Uncertainty estimation and propagation for accelerated MRI
- Paper 2: UQ for clinical decision
- Paper 3: Used uncertainties should be useful
- Paper 4: Bringing all together: propagation, calibration, action

## Conclusion + future work
- Why pipelines
- Model performance and uncertainty
- Interacting uncertainties
- personal: future work (ML for pediatrics) and thanks
