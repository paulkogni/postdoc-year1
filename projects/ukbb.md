# 18.11.2025 Meeting Suliman (Cost estimation clinical data)
## General 
- What we can get easily
    - whether in- or out-patients (admitted or not); important to know for which data is avialable
    - ICD-10 codes (diagnosis)
    - Treatment codes
    - vitals (age, sex, ...)
- Harder to get
    - Drug administrations
    - Lab values 

- other available data: text reports (already accessible through kissim)


## TODOs from my side
- [ ] look into text anonymization for the reports
